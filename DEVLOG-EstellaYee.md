## Estella Yee -- I CHANGED THE NAME FOOL!

### 2025-05-22 - Brief description
Expanded description including how much time was spent on task.

- I played a lot of Pacman as research for our project--5 minutes 
- Thinking about logic with Kiran--20 minutes 
- Created processing sketches for all the classes we need--2 minutes 
- Started writing the basic Game methods including: setup, draw, drawSquares, keyPressed--30 minutes 
- Coached Kiran through her tasks--Ongoing

### 2025-05-23 - Brief description
- Imported Mazecarver algorithm to the field class - 30 minutes 
- Struggled with visualizing how our game is going to work - 40 minutes
- Decided that we will be making a custom map 

### 2025-05-26 - Brief description
- I generated a small practice map based on the google Pacman, just to see if our wall/points would work 
- I drew a custom map (look out for the K and E :D)
- I tediously input every value for wall/point/blank space in our 2D map array to make our beautiful map

### 2025-05-27 
- I added in the point system in the node class 
- I tried for a third time to understand how the nodes and edges worked 
- I tried to help Kiran write the nodes and edges but failed, because it's kind of confusing 
- Sighed a lot. 

### 2025-05-28 
- Tried to fix the issue where pacman doesn't right the up and left direction all the way (probably spent hours trying to figure this out but couldn't...)
- Added in the rotating image feature.
