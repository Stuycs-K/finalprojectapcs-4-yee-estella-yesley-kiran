## Estella Yee -- I CHANGED THE NAME FOOL!

### 2025-05-22 - Brief description
Expanded description including how much time was spent on task.

- I played a lot of Pacman as research for our project--5 minutes 
- Thinking about logic with Kiran--20 minutes 
- Created processing sketches for all the classes we need--2 minutes 
- Started writing the basic Game methods including: setup, draw, drawSquares, keyPressed--30 minutes 
- Coached Kiran through her tasks--Ongoing

### 2025-05-23 - Brief description
- Imported Mazecarver algorithm to the field class - 30 minutes 
- Struggled with visualizing how our game is going to work - 40 minutes
- Decided that we will be making a custom map 

### 2025-05-26 - Brief description
- I generated a small practice map based on the google Pacman, just to see if our wall/points would work 
- I drew a custom map (look out for the K and E :D)
- I tediously input every value for wall/point/blank space in our 2D map array to make our beautiful map

### 2025-05-27 
- I added in the point system in the node class 
- I tried for a third time to understand how the nodes and edges worked 
- I tried to help Kiran write the nodes and edges but failed, because it's kind of confusing 
- Sighed a lot. 

### 2025-05-28 
- Tried to fix the issue where pacman doesn't right the up and left direction all the way (probably spent hours trying to figure this out but couldn't...)
- Added in the rotating image feature. 

### 2025-05-29 
- Made enirely new character class because everything was extremely complicated - 1.5 hours 
- Maade entirely new pacman class - 1.5 hours 
- Also started making the Ghost class, inserted all the methods 1 hour 

### 2025-05-30-06-1
- Tried to debug ghost movement in class - 20 minutes 
- Made progress setting up different modes in the Ghosts and understanding their target mechanisms - 1 hours 
- Fixed the ghosts issue with continuously going back and forth in place (no 180 degree turning) - 1 hours 

### 2025-06-02 
- Made the blue state transition images - 30 minutes
- Made blue state adhere to a certain time frame - 10 minutes 
- Coded so that in blue state the ghost should run away from Pacman - 10 minutes

### 2025-06-03 
- Cleared up clutter in code with blue state/vulnerable state - 10 minutes
- Tried to code the death of the ghosts and have them run back to the base when they come in contact with Pacman - 40 minutes 
- Coded Pinky's targeting mechanism, but was not able to test because there are still bugs in the scatter mode; 

### 2025-06-04-05
- Made a to-do list for everything we need to finish an a schedule to get things done by. 5 min
- Worked on making a new move method with BFS searching mechanism.
