# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Estella Yee, Kiran Yesley        
# IDEAS:

1. PACMAN
- We will simulate a Pacman arcade game.
- First, to make the map we will generate mazes (like in the forest fire lab), and each time we run the game we'll generate a new map.
- We can have people choose their avatars so it's not necessarily just the basic whatever fortune cookie looking pacman is.
- We'll have a class for the little ghosts, and we can treat them like netlogo turtles and have them respond to the walls around them.
  - For their flashing blue modes, we will have them activate when pacman eats the bigger orbs.
- if we can import images in place of the cherries, and ghosts, that would be cool.
- Hopefully we can make a high scoreboard, and store than somehow!!! 

  Potential Challenges:
    - how would we make the ghosts move on their own with a little bit of intelligence? It might be kind of boring with them just moving randomly.  
    - how can we make animations for the ghosts when transitioning between their blue state and normal?
