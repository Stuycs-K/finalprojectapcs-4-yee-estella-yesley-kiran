# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Estella Yee, Kiran Yesley        
# IDEAS:

1. PACMAN
- We will simulate a Pacman arcade game.
- First, to make the map we will generate mazes (like in the forest fire lab), and each time we run the game we'll generate a new map.
- We can have people choose their avatars so it's not necessarily just the basic whatever fortune cookie looking pacman is.
- We'll have a class for the little ghosts, and we can treat them like netlogo turtles and have them respond to the walls around them.
  - For their flashing blue modes, we will have them activate when pacman eats the bigger orbs.
- if we can import images in place of the cherries, and ghosts, that would be cool.
- Hopefully we can make a high scoreboard, and store than somehow!!! 

  Potential Challenges:
    - how would we make the ghosts move on their own with a little bit of intelligence? It might be kind of boring with them just moving randomly.  
    - how can we make animations for the ghosts when transitioning between their blue state and normal?

2. CROSSY ROAD
- This game is based off the Crossy Road Arcade Game ( https://crossy-road.com/ ) and will ultimately answer the unanswered life question: what happens when the chicken crosses the road?
- It will have several game modes: single player, dual player, slippery mode(?)
- Because of the limitations of processing (unless other software is allowed) we will likely make this a 2d version of Crossy Road 

  Potential Challenges:
    - Making the infinite loop of obstacles (logs across the river and cars ) 
    - Implementing the hawk that catches the chicken/duck after a certain amount of time

3. DONKEY KONG
- This gamed is based off the simple 2d platformer game Donkey Kong : https://freekong.org/
- This will have the ladder feature and a score/high score feature as well 
- unless we have time this will likely not include the start animation 

  Potential Challenges:
    - creating platformer physics (for the people and the barrels) -- especially since its on a slant
    - creating animations for mario (jumping and climbing) and donkey kong (rolling the barrel)
